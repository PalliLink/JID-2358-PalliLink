<h1 align="center">PalliNet</h1>

Many studies have been done confirming the benefits of early palliative care such as improved symptom control and improved quality of care for patients. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that only about 14% of people who need palliative care receive it. One of the few major shortcomings in access to palliative care is the lack of resources and awareness of palliative care. When a patient meets with their primary care doctor or other specialist doctors, the patients receive treatment for their underlying ailments, but their symptoms, in the meantime, may be overlooked. The aim of a palliative care coordination app is to offload the responsibility of connecting patients with palliative care specialists from the primary care doctor.

We are creating PalliNet in order to make palliative care specialists more accessible for patients. Patients will be able to set up meetings with palliative care experts and easily share prescribed treatments and results with their existing primary care provider. The app will serve as a hub for all palliative care treatment results and will be the patientâ€™s primary gateway to communicate with their palliative care provider.

PalliNet will not only provide access to palliative care specialists, but also provide an easy way for primary healthcare providers to see how patients react to care and plan repeat appointments and/or referrals to specialists
